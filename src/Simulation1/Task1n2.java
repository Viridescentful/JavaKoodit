    When simualtion scenarios, you are able to catch underlying issues which could be detrimental in practise and cause;
    irreversable damage to the system/environment.

    As previously stated, simulation also gives a deeper look into things, which normal immitation cannot cover.

    /* Simulation2.Task2
    In supermarkets, the pricing system for items shares a level of complexity, variability and interconnectedness.;

    When the price of an item changes in the catalogue, all connected stores should automatically adjust to that;
    or change the price with variability to the price. This could happen due to a sale for an item, like 2 cans of soda;
    for the price of 1.

    Supermarkets also have to be able to calculate possible variance that ia added when an item is put on-sale through other means;
    which would then total for the price.

    In the long run, depending on the customers demand, the supermarket may also increase the request amount for a certain item;
    which in turn increases demand for the stock and also the demand for the item in specific from the factory.
