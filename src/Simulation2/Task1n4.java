    The arrival reduces the need for more B type events, by making both types of customers orriginating from the same arrival event;
    and checking the type of call when in queue for service.

    The second question is a bit unclear if we are looking to set the initial state of the whole system or if we are looking to start Phase A;
    and prepare B events for execution.
