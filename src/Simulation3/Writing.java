    Module3dot2.Task1

    We would make a new table with the MAXAGE + 1 being the amount of integers it has. When an age is drawn, we would go to the index;
    based on the age and increment it up by 1. After the 1000 draws, we would loop through the table, ignoring the integers which are 0;
    and then displaying how many of each age there are and the percentage portion.

    Task3
    Because it's private like stated. The getInstance() can also only create a single one, as otherwise it will refer to the pre-existing one

    Task4
    Normal, Uniform and Exponential Distrobutions, just to name a few. Easiest to understand being uniform, as odds of getting any option;
    are almost the same, with little variance.
